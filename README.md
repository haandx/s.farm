## the problem:
 all agricultural practices have been found to have a variety of effects on the environment. Some of the environmental effects include:
1. Loss of crops and consequently food loss, which affects the environment and the land.
2. The impacts of water mismanagement on the natural environment.

## the solution:
The application provides easy services for farmers to access and manage their farms through the Internet of Things (IoT) by converting the farm into a smart farm and achieving the 7th , 11th and 12th of Sustainable Development goals

## Key Challenges and Concrete Solutions:
1. Food security using SOLAR POWERED COLD STORAGE feature
2. reducing the loss of crops and the amount of water by using SMART IRRIGATION feature
3.Sustainable environment
